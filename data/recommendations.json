        "summary":"I am pleased to recommend Vineeth Devi Prasad Rao. I know him quite well, for more than three years. I have taught him in several classes and served as his adviser. He attended many of the events sponsored by my Alexander Hamilton Institute. Simply put, Mr. Rao is one of the most courteous and well-mannered students I have taught in thirty-five years at Hamilton College. He has a fine sense of humor and a versatile mind. I have taught him in two great books classes. He has read Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws and Tocqueville's Democracy in America cover to cover. He speaks and writes English fluently. He has keen interests in physics and engineering. He plays the piano beautifully. Should you hire Mr. Rao, you would be getting a cultured, intelligent, and gifted young person who could be something quite special if he channels his energies in a particular direction. I recommend him enthusiastically. Should you need any additional information, please don't hesitate to contact me at any time.",
